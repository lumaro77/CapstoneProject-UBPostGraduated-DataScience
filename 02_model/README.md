## Aprouch to the solution

The problem will be as an AI image classification
- Depicted to label images with a label (helthy-injury) and (kind of lession/injury).
- The proposed framework is PyTorch.
- The proposed processing environtment is Google Colab.

## Structure of the solution

The first approach will be based on the use of a tipycal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) like Residual Neural Network (RESNET) family.

General steps of the solution will be:

- Load of the training dataset.
- Definition of the Convolutional Neural Network.
- Definition of a Loss function and optimizer.
- Training the network (GPU support).
- Test the network on the test data.
- Analysis of the results
